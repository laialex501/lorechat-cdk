2. Secure and properly configured AWS environment
3. Scalable architecture to handle varying loads
4. Integrated monitoring and alerting
5. Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
6. Flexible LLM and Vector DB integrations
7. Multi-AZ reliability
8. Cost-effective resource usage
9. Comprehensive documentation

## Infrastructure Goals
- Reliable and resilient cloud architecture
- Secure communication between components
- Cost-effective resource utilization
- Simplified deployment and management
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Key Infrastructure Patterns
1. Separation of concerns through multiple stacks
2. Secure networking with proper VPC configuration
3. Containerized deployment with ECS
4. Integrated monitoring and alerting
5. Secrets management for API keys
