# LoreChatCDK Project Brief

## Overview
LoreChatCDK is an AWS CDK infrastructure project designed to deploy and manage the cloud resources required for the LoreChat application. It provides a complete, code-defined infrastructure for hosting the LoreChatContainer Streamlit application on AWS, with proper networking, security, monitoring, and integration with AWS services.

## Core Requirements
- Complete AWS infrastructure for LoreChat deployment
- Secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud architecture
- Integration with AWS services (ECS, OpenSearch, Bedrock, etc.)
- Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CDK
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Project Scope
- Infrastructure Stack (VPC, Route 53, API Gateway, Security Groups, Secrets Manager)
- Service Stack (ALB, ECS Cluster, ECS Service, Log Groups)
- LLM Stack (OpenSearch for vector storage, Bedrock LLM integration)
- Monitoring Stack (CloudWatch Dashboards, CloudWatch Alarms)
- External API access (OpenAI)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Key Technologies
- AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- AWS Services:
  - Compute: ECS, Fargate
  - Networking: VPC, ALB, API Gateway, Route 53
  - Security: IAM, Security Groups, Secrets Manager
  - Storage: OpenSearch
  - AI/ML: Bedrock
  - Monitoring: CloudWatch
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Deployment
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated deployment via CI/CD
- Secure parameter handling

## Success Criteria
1. Complete infrastructure deployment for LoreChat application
2. Secure and properly configured networking components
3. Scalable ECS service with appropriate auto-scaling policies
4. Integrated monitoring and alerting
5. Successful integration with LLM services (Bedrock, OpenAI)
6. CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
7. Cost-effective resource utilization

## Timeline
4-week plan: Setup, Core Infrastructure, Service Integration, Monitoring & CI/CD

## Key Challenges
- Secure API key management
- Proper VPC configuration for external API access
- ECS service optimization for Streamlit
- Integration between infrastructure components
- Cost optimization
- Multi-environment configuration

## Project Governance
Git version control, infrastructure testing, documentation, code reviews, security best practices
