## Key Infrastructure Patterns

### 1. Service Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Edge & Security"
        CF[CloudFront] --> WAF[WAF Rules]
        WAF --> ALB[Load Balancer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Real-time Communication"
        ALB --> WS[WebSocket Layer]
        WS --> ECS[ECS Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Processing"
        ECS --> VS[Vector Search]
        ECS --> LLM[LLM Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        ECS --> CW[CloudWatch]
        CW --> Metrics[Custom Metrics]
        CW --> Alarms[Auto-scaling]
    end
```

### 2. Core Patterns
1. Multi-stack separation of concerns
2. WebSocket-enabled edge architecture
3. Hybrid search implementation
4. Factory-based service abstraction
5. Intelligent auto-scaling
6. Comprehensive monitoring

### 3. Performance Architecture

graph TD
    subgraph "Performance Optimization"
        A[Edge Caching] --> B[Response Time]
        C[Hybrid Search] --> D[Query Accuracy]
        E[Auto-scaling] --> F[Resource Efficiency]
        G[WebSockets] --> H[Real-time Updates]
    end
    
    subgraph "Resource Management"
        I[Spot Instances] --> J[Cost Optimization]
        K[Public Subnets] --> L[Direct Routing]
        M[Batch Processing] --> N[Throughput]
    end
```

### Scalability Implementation
- Dynamic resource allocation through ECS auto-scaling
- Intelligent metric-based scaling decisions

- Optimized vector search operations
- Cost-effective infrastructure design

## Development Philosophy

### 1. Infrastructure Design
```typescript
// Example: Factory Pattern Implementation
class LLMServiceFactory {
  static create(config: LLMConfig): ILLMService {
    switch (config.provider) {
      case 'openai':
        return new OpenAIService(config);
      case 'anthropic':
        return new AnthropicService(config);
      case 'bedrock':
        return new BedrockService(config);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${config.provider}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Operational Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Infrastructure Management"
        A[CDK Deployment] --> B[Stack Updates]
        B --> C[Health Checks]
        C --> D[Monitoring]
    end
    
    subgraph "Auto Recovery"
        E[Issue Detection] --> F[Auto-scaling]
        F --> G[Health Restoration]
        G --> H[Verification]
    end
    
    subgraph "Cost Control"
        I[Resource Tracking] --> J[Budget Alerts]
        J --> K[Optimization]
        K --> L[Adjustment]
    end
```
